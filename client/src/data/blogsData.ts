      'AHAs (Glycolic, Lactic) exfoliate the surface and boost moisture retention.',
      'BHAs (Salicylic Acid) penetrate oil-filled pores to dissolve blackheads and acne plugs.',
      'PHAs are ultra-gentle second-generation exfoliants ideal for reactive, rosacea-prone skin.',
      'Hyaluronic Acid is a humectant (water-binder), not an exfoliating acid, and can be used twice daily.',

          'The cosmetic industry borrowed the term "acid" from laboratory chemistry, which causes unnecessary fear among beginners. In dermatological science, active acids are naturally occurring organic compounds—often isolated from milk sugars, sugar cane, bitter almonds, or willow tree bark.',
          'Rather than abrasively scrubbing away living tissue like granular physical scrubs, skin acids dissolve the biological "glue" (desmosomes) binding expired, dull dead keratinocytes to your epidermal surface.',

          'Glycolic Acid (Smallest molecule): Penetrates deepest and fastest; ideal for resilient, non-sensitive skin seeking dramatic glow.',
